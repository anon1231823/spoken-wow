/**
 * Write restored stage directions into line_override.
 *
 * The companion to tools/restore_stage_directions.py, which computes the text and writes
 * nothing. This puts it in Postgres, as overrides rather than as a corpus change: an override
 * is exactly "what a line should say instead of what the corpus says it says" (migration
 * 0012), it is keyed on the file like the regeneration queue, and clearing a row undoes it.
 *
 * Writing a row does not generate anything. It makes the line's live audio *stale* - the take
 * predates the text - which is what turns this into a worklist rather than a fait accompli.
 *
 * Dry run by default. Nothing is written without --write.
 *
 *   cd web && node scripts/apply-overrides.mjs /tmp/restored.json          # says what it would do
 *   cd web && node scripts/apply-overrides.mjs /tmp/restored.json --write  # does it
 *
 * It lives under web/ rather than tools/ because `pg` is a web dependency and this is the
 * app's database; from tools/ the import does not resolve.
 *
 * DATABASE_URL decides which database, so pointing it at the droplet is a deliberate act.
 * Run it against a local database first and listen to a line before doing that.
