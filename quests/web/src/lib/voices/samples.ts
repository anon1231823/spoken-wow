/**
 * The clips a voice clone is built from.
 *
 * Stored at voice/samples/<race-gender>/, one directory per slot. These are kept rather
 * than discarded after cloning: an ElevenLabs voice cannot be exported, so the clips are
 * the only way to remake one — which is exactly what was lost when this project inherited
 * voices it could not reproduce.
 *
 * Limits here are ours, not the API's. ElevenLabs' own guidance is that the file count does
 * not matter and total length does: 1-2 minutes is the target and past ~3 minutes makes the
 * clone worse, not better. Duration is measured in the browser, so nothing on this side
 * needs to decode audio.
