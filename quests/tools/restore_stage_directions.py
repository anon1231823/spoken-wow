"""Recover the stage directions the pipeline deleted before synthesis.

`preprocess_dataframe` strips `<.*?>\\s` from every line before it is spoken, so 305 lines
ship with their stage direction silently missing: the NPC says its words and the game's
narration is simply gone. The web app can now voice a direction (a narrator reads it), so
those lines can be restored.

WHY NO CORPUS REBUILD. The direction was never lost - only the *cleaned* text lost it, and
`originalText` in the committed corpus still carries it. So the restored text is recovered by
re-running the same cleaning against `originalText` and omitting the one strip. That is
reproduced here from tts_cli, not reimplemented: REPLACE_DICT and the `$G` pattern are
imported, so a change there changes this.

THE SAFETY INVARIANT, and the reason to trust the output: for every line emitted, stripping
the restored text again must reproduce the corpus's `text` exactly. If it does not, this
script has changed something other than putting the direction back, and the line is dropped
rather than guessed at. On the current corpus every line either satisfies that or is excluded
for the reason below.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED. Six lines hold a lowercase *sound* rather than a direction -
`<cough>`, `<hic>`, `<yawn>`, `<drool>`, `<sigh>`. Nothing voices those yet, so restoring one
would turn a line with working audio into a line the gate refuses. Capitalisation is what
tells a direction from a sound; see web/src/lib/generation/narration.ts.

This writes nothing. It prints a JSON artifact for review; web/scripts/apply-overrides.mjs is what
puts the rows in Postgres.
