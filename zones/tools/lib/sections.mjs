// Deciding which parts of a wiki article are lore.
//
// A warcraft.wiki.gg article is written for players, and only some of it is the
// story of a place. The rest -- quest tables, NPC lists, "Patch changes", the RPG
// sourcebook material the wiki itself marks non-canon -- is noise for an addon that
// narrates lore, and the earlier lead-only scrape avoided it by never looking past
// the intro. That also cost us every article's History section, which is where the
// pre-WoW lore lives.
//
// So: read the whole article, and classify by heading. Measured over the 224 full
// articles cached under tools/cache/, the headings are consistent enough to do this
// deterministically -- which matters, because the alternative is asking a model to
// decide what counts as lore, and a deterministic filter is one fewer thing that can
// go wrong silently.

// Headings whose prose is the story of the place. Everything else is dropped.
//
// Geography is usually a bulleted list of sub-locations rather than prose, and
// contributes little; it is kept because on the articles where it *is* prose it is
// good prose, and the rewrite discards lists anyway.
//
// Overview is the one risky member: Sen'jin Village's Overview is "the first
// settlement most orcs encounter ... only two professions trained here", exactly the
// fourth-wall noise this whole pipeline exists to remove. It earns its place because
// on most articles it is ordinary description, and the rewrite step is what strips
// player-facing framing.

// rewrite step as facts about the world rather than furniture from a website.
