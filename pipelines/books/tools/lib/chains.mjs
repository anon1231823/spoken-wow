 * Every voiceable page, plus the pages nothing in the world can open.
 *
 * Orphans are counted rather than dropped silently: vmangos carries page text for content
 * that was cut, and a number that moves between dumps is the signal that the extract's
 * owner queries have gone wrong -- which would otherwise look merely like a quieter corpus.
 *
 * `shared` holds pages a second book's chain runs into. One page is one line id, so a page
 * can belong to one book only, and the alternative -- emitting it once per chain -- puts
 * two rows with the same lineId in an import that then has to pick one. vmangos has one
 * such page today: 265 is page 4 of the Hillsbrad Town Registry, and a deprecated test
 * item starts its chain there.
