 * The structural fields the extract has moved, whatever the text says.
 *
 * Text and structure are versioned differently on purpose. Text is content: a new version
 * is recorded so the history shows it, and an edit outranks the dump. Structure is a fact
 * about the world -- which book a page belongs to, what number it is, what the object is
 * called -- and 0026 says plainly that it is the extract's business and not an editor's.
 * So structure is corrected in place on the live row, on edited lines too.
 *
 * Without this, a page could only be re-placed by changing its text as well. One page moved
 * between books the first time this ran, when a deprecated test item stopped claiming page
 * 265 of the Hillsbrad Town Registry, and its text never changed at all.
