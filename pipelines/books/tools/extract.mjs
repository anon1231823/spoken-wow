// MYSQL_*, the same names the quests pipeline reads, out of the same repo-root .env. It is
// one vmangos dump and one set of credentials; two spellings of them was a way for the two
// extracts to disagree about which database they were reading.
//
// These names used to be BOOKS_-prefixed, and the reason is still live: generic names like
// MYSQL_PASSWORD are exported by other projects, and an ambient one turns "connect to the
// local vmangos" into an access-denied error that looks like the dump is missing. One such
// variable was already exported on the machine this was written on. What makes the prefix
// unnecessary is loadEnv: this file now reads .env rather than relying on whatever the
// shell happens to export, exactly as tts_cli/env_vars.py has with override=True.
//
// THE LOAD HAS TO COME FIRST. The defaults below are the quests pipeline's docker-compose
// values, and they are what an unread .env silently falls back to.
