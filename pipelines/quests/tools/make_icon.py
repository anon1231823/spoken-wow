"""Turn the project artwork into the TGA the client shows beside an addon's name.

    python tools/make_icon.py assets/icon/spoken-quests-512.png assets/icon/spoken-quests.tga

WHY NOT JUST ffmpeg. Its targa encoder writes RLE (image type 10) and ignores
-compression_algo raw on the versions to hand; the client wants an uncompressed image. So
ffmpeg only decodes to raw BGRA here and the 18-byte header is written below, which is also
the whole of the TGA format that matters for a 64x64 icon.

BOTTOM-UP, 32-bit. The descriptor byte says which corner row zero is, and bottom-up is the
convention every WoW addon icon follows; a top-down file loads upside down rather than
failing, which is the kind of bug that survives review.

Committed as a TGA rather than converted at build time so that building an addon needs no
ffmpeg - the same reason the corpus is committed. Re-run it (`make quests-icon`) when the
SVGs beside the PNGs change and their renders are re-exported.

ONE ICON PER ADDON. The player carries the play triangle, Spoken Quests and its five sound
packs the exclamation mark; they sit next to each other in the AddOns list, so the same
artwork on both would say they are the same thing.
