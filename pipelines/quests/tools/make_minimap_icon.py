"""Turn the project artwork into the BLP the minimap button wears.

    python3 tools/make_minimap_icon.py assets/icon/spoken-player-512.png \
        ../../addons/SpokenPlayer/Textures/MinimapButton.blp

NO FRAME. LibDBIcon draws the icon 17x17 inside "Interface\\Minimap\\MiniMap-TrackingBorder",
so the octagonal gold frame the AddOns-list mark wears would sit inside a second, rounder
frame and read as mud at that size. This crops the frame away and keeps the field and the
glyph, which is why the source is the same 512px render the TGA is made from rather than
artwork of its own: one mark, two crops. LibDBIcon also trims a further 5% off each edge
while the button is not pressed, so nothing that matters may touch the border.

WHY BLP AND NOT TGA. The AddOns-list icon is read by the client's addon list, which takes
either; a texture a frame loads is BLP on every client this ships to, and the 1.12/2.4.3
clients are the reason not to experiment.

WHY DXT5 AND NOT A PALETTE. A palettized BLP2 (colour encoding 1) is legal by the format's
own rules and is what vanilla's interface art used, but the Classic beta client -- build
69913, 1.60.1 -- asserts inside its image decoder on one and takes the game down with it
(Engine/Source/Images/StaticImage.cpp). Encoding 2 with preferred format 7, DXT5, is what
all 70 of the other textures in this project are, including the button this one replaces,
so it is the format known to load on every client the addons ship to. A 32x32 icon fits in
2.5 KB of it and the banding a block compressor gives a gradient is invisible at 17 pixels.

NO ffmpeg. The previous version shelled out to it to scale and quantize; decoding one PNG
and box-filtering it is a page of the standard library, and dropping the dependency means
the mark can be rebuilt on a machine that only has Python -- the same reason the result is
committed rather than converted at build time. Re-run it (`make icon`) when the artwork
changes.

ONE PALETTE PER BLOCK, EVERY MIP. Each level is laid out from the full-size render rather
than halved from the level above, so the glyph stays centred on the field at every size
instead of accumulating the rounding error of five successive halvings.
