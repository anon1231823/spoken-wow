// AreaTable is the table GetSubZoneText and MapUtil.FindBestAreaNameAtMouse
// read from, so it is the definitive list of area names the Era client can ever
// report. The wiki's subzone categories mix every era of the game -- Cataclysm's
// Ruins of Auberdine, BfA's warfront Stromgarde, even Plunderstorm -- and 497 of
// the corpus's 1304 subzones turned out not to exist in the client at all.
// Everything that consumes the corpus filters against this seed instead of
// trusting the wiki's idea of what is a place.
//
// The dump comes from wago.tools, which serves Blizzard's own client database
// per build. The result is committed so scrapes and validation stay
// deterministic and offline; re-run this only to move to a newer client build.
//
// One quirk worth knowing: Season of Discovery runs on the same 1.15 client, so
// its areas are in this table too. Almost all of them are phased copies reusing
// vanilla names; the one SoD-only name that reaches the corpus is Storm Cliffs
// in Azshara. Kept deliberately -- the filter's contract is "the client can
// report this name", not "this is vanilla lore".
