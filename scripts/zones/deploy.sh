# The addon ships for two clients and the only way to know it loads on both is to
# load it on both, so which client to install into is a variable rather than a
# constant. Installing targets one client; --status and --remove walk every client
# that is installed, because the failure they exist to catch is a stale copy left
# behind in the one you were not thinking about.
#
# Symlinking is preferred: no re-run needed after each edit. If the client's
# AddOns list does not show Spoken Zones, fall back to --copy and re-run per change.
#
# Both addons are handled together. The sound pack is optional to the player but
# not to development: symlinking it means a generation run lands in the client
# without a redeploy, exactly as an edit to a .lua does.
#
# SavedVariables live under WTF/, not in the addon folder, so neither mode can
# destroy saved settings.
