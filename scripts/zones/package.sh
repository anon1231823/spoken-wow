# The version comes from `## Version:` in the .toc, so bumping the addon and
# naming the zip stay one edit rather than two.
#
# Addon hosts unpack the zip straight into Interface/AddOns, so its root must
# contain the ZoneLore/ folder itself -- hence the staging copy before zipping.
#
# SOURCE DIRECTORY AND SHIPPED FOLDER NAME ARE NOT THE SAME THING. The source lives
# at addons/SpokenZones/, but what a player installs must still be called ZoneLore
# until the rename ships with its SavedVariables migration -- an installed folder is
# the addon's identity to the client and to LibDBIcon. ADDON says where to read from,
# NAME says what to write.
