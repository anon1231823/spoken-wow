#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The complete pack cannot be uploaded: 577 MB comes back from Cloudflare as
# a 413 before CurseForge sees the body, which is why the audio ships split four ways in the
# first place. But "install everything with one click" is still worth having, and CurseForge
# already has the mechanism - a file can declare required dependencies on other projects, and
# both the CurseForge app and WowUp install those automatically. So this is a few kilobytes
# that owns no audio and lists the four packs as dependencies; scripts/release.sh sends that
# list with the upload.
#
# Bundling the four folders into one zip instead would not help twice over: the zip would be
# the same 565 MB and hit the same limit, and those folder names would then be owned by two
# projects at once, so a manager tracking Alliance from both would update each over the other.
#
# NO DataModule KEYS OF EITHER GENERATION (X-SpokenQuests-* or X-VoiceOver-*), deliberately. The player enumerates packs by that key, so a
# stub carrying it would count as an installed pack: somebody holding only this would be told
# nothing is missing while hearing silence. See DataModules:EnumerateAddons.
#
# IT TAKES THE BARE VoiceOverReduxAudio NAME, which the split packs left free. That name is
# what the pre-split pack used, so a player updating from it has their old 1.5 GB folder
# replaced by this stub and the packs installed alongside - the migration falls out of the
# rename rather than needing anything.
