# Changelog — Spoken Player

## 1.0.0 — 2026-09-11

The player every Spoken addon speaks through: one queue, one window, one minimap button.

- Extracted from VoiceOver Redux and ZoneLore, which each carried their own copy.
- One FIFO across every addon; nothing interrupts. Gossip yields to quest dialogue at the door.
- Narration held through combat no longer blocks a quest line queued behind it.
- A quest line plays with its NPC and its title shown. The portrait is resolved before the
  rows, and asking a model frame a question the current clients no longer answer abandoned
  the rest of the update, leaving a portrait over an empty band.
- `/spoken` is a command the client recognises. It never was.
- The minimap button's tooltip gets out of the way when the menu opens, instead of
  sitting over it.
- The minimap menu is the client's own on every client that has one, so it looks and
  behaves like every other addon's: entries grouped under each addon's name, a highlight
  under the cursor, closing on a second click or a click elsewhere. The 1.12, 2.4.3 and
  3.3.5 clients have no such menu, and there the player draws its own with the same
  behaviours and a background of its own. It asked for the backdrop template and never set a
  backdrop, so its entries read as text floating over the game world.
- The settings layout is shared with Spoken Quests and Spoken Zones, so the three panels
  read alike.
- The settings panel keeps one rhythm. Every row used to place itself by adding a
  hand-tuned offset, so no two sections were spaced alike; one layout owns the spacing
  now. The links to each addon's own settings have a section of their own instead of
  trailing the minimap ones.
- The settings category is "Spoken Player", and the window's settings are headed as such
  rather than by "Up next", the queue window's own title.
- The player scale slider is visible. It was built without a height, so it drew nothing
  and left a gap on the panel where the setting should have been.
- Every sound setting lives here: the channel everything speaks on, and silencing the
  game's own NPC dialogue while a line is read. Each feature addon used to carry its own
  channel control, so a player with both had two settings for one thing.
- 2.4.3 and 3.3.5 gain rows for the music-channel playback those clients need, and for the
  HD model patch. Both settings existed from the start with no way to reach them.
- Settings under Spoken Player; the frame's position, scale and lock, the minimap button and the sound channel migrate from either old addon on first login.
