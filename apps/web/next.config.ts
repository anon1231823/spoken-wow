  // the narrow one was set to prevent. Next's tracer statically evaluates the
  // path.resolve() in src/lib/paths.ts, resolves it to a real directory, and pulls the
  // whole thing in: the first build after the change traced 2,741 files and 127 MB --
  // the Python virtualenv, .pytest_cache, and pipelines/quests/.env, which holds the
  // ElevenLabs key and the database password. A release bundle is rsynced to the
  // droplet, so that is a credential leak and not merely weight. With these excludes the
  // bundle is 4.6 MB.
