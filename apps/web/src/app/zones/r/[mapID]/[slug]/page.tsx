/**
 * One zone line, and the form to complain about it.
 *
 * Where the addon's Report button sends people. The client cannot open a URL or post
 * anywhere, so what it can offer is an address to copy, and this is the page at the end of
 * it: the line they were just reading, the narration they were just hearing, and the form,
 * already pointed at the right line -- which is the whole saving over telling them to go
 * and find it among 1,353 rows in the explorer.
 *
 * Deliberately not the explorer, for the reason the quests landing page is not either.
 * Someone arriving from the game is a player, not a collaborator; flags, takes, staleness
 * and the regenerate controls are answers to questions they did not ask.
 *
 * The address is /zones/r/{mapID}/{slug} -- the same path the line's audio file uses --
 * because the addon can build it from what it already has, with no per-line table and
 * nothing to escape. See SpokenZones' ReportURL. Builds already in players' hands point at
 * lore.rusty.one/{lang}/r/... and lore.rusty.one/r/...; both are redirected here.
