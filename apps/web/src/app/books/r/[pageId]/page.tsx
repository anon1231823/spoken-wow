/**
 * One page of one book, and the form to complain about it.
 *
 * Where SpokenBooks' Report button sends people. The client cannot open a URL or post
 * anywhere, so what the addon can offer is an address to copy, and this is the page at the
 * end of it: the words they were just reading, the narration they were just hearing, and the
 * form already pointed at the right line -- which is the whole saving over telling them to
 * find it among 1,191 pages in the explorer.
 *
 * Deliberately not the explorer, for the reason the zones and quests landing pages are not
 * either. Someone arriving from the game is a player, not a collaborator; flags, takes,
 * staleness and the regenerate controls are answers to questions they did not ask.
 *
 * The address is /books/r/{pageTextID} -- the page id and nothing else -- because the addon
 * can build it from what it already has, with no per-page table to ship and nothing to
 * escape. docs/books/AGENTS.md freezes that id, which is what makes the address safe to bake
 * into a release. See SpokenBooks' ReportURL.
