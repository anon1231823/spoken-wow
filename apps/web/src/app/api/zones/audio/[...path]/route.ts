 * A zones line's live take: /api/zones/audio/1411/razor-hill.mp3.

 * The guard is membership in the set of paths the catalogue can address, which is
 * traversal-proof by construction: a path either names a file some line owns or it does
 * not exist, and no amount of "../" produces a member of that set. Which take plays is the
 * row's `isCurrent`; the bytes are that take's archived file.
