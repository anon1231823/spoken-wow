/**
 * The accent direction for each race.
 *
 * Its own endpoint rather than a field of PUT ../settings, because the two are edited in
 * different places: a tag is set on /voices while looking at that race's voices, and the
 * model and sliders are set once in the settings form. Sharing a write would let a tag edit
 * revert a model change made a minute earlier in another tab.
 *
 * `admin`, matching PUT beside it and for the same reason: a direction applies to every line
 * of that race anyone generates afterwards.
