/**
 * Filing a report.
 *
 * POST IS THE ONLY UNAUTHENTICATED WRITE IN THIS APP. Anyone on the internet can reach it,
 * because the person best placed to report a bad line is a player who has just heard one and
 * has no account here. Every defence below exists because of that, and any verb added to this
 * path inherits the exposure - put it in a sibling route instead, as /resolve is.
 *
 * A report never becomes a regeneration job. Regenerating spends ElevenLabs credits, so a
 * public write that could start one would be a public write that spends money. A collaborator
 * reads the report and queues the file through the existing flow.

   * A quests address is one the addon built out of a quest id and an event, or out of a
   * unit GUID, and it can legitimately resolve to nothing -- when the data module failed to
   * load there is no sound data at all, and that is the failure most worth reporting. So it
   * is validated for shape and the lineId is filled in only if it resolves.
   *
   * A zones address is the line's own audio path, because that is what the report link is,
   * and it either names a line or it does not. Accepting one that names nothing would put a
   * row in triage that nobody can act on -- there is no equivalent of a data module having
   * failed to load, since the address came from a page this site rendered.
   *
   * A books address is the page id the addon built its link from, and is resolved as strictly
   * as a zones one for the same reason: the reporter got here from a page this site rendered,
   * so an id naming nothing is a typo in the URL bar rather than a corpus that failed to load.
