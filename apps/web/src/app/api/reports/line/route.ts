/**
 * Every report filed against one line, for the popover on an explorer row.

 * A sibling of /api/reports rather than a GET on it, for the reason /resolve is: that path's
 * POST is open to the internet, and these are the bodies strangers wrote, which only the
 * people who triage them may read. The count stays public on the row; this does not.
 *
 * Resolved reports come back too, after the open ones, so a report closed by mistake from
 * the row can be reopened from the same place.
