/**
 * The form a player fills in after copying an address out of the game.
 *
 * The success screen matters more than it looks: a reporter cannot read their report back, so
 * a form that merely cleared itself would leave them with no evidence anything happened and a
 * fair chance of filing the same thing twice.
 *
 * A signed-in reporter is not asked who they are. The endpoint takes their identity from
 * the session and drops whatever the body claims -- letting somebody sign in and then type
 * another person's name is a way to put words in their mouth -- so the two fields were a
 * lie to anyone signed in: filled in carefully, ignored on arrival. They are shown to a
 * visitor, who has no other way to be reachable, and replaced by a line naming the account
 * for everyone else.
 *
 * One form for all three sections, against one endpoint and one table. The two sites each had
 * their own, with their own category vocabulary, and triage was two lists -- which is two
 * places to forget to look. What differs between them is the address: a quest report carries
 * one the addon built and a zone report may carry none at all, because its report page is
 * reached with the line already identified.
