 * filed here is indistinguishable from one filed from the game, which is what keeps triage
 * one list rather than three.
 *
 * It was three dialogs and two of them existed: quests carried the lineId as well as the
 * address, because an NPC address names every line that speaker has and a reporter coming
 * from the game picks one by hand, while the zones one passed a file path and had a
 * never-used "general" mode. Both of those are the same shape once the address is asked for
 * per source, which is what reportTargetOf does.
