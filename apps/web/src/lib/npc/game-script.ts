/**
 * The chat commands that make a game client fetch a list of NPCs from its server.
 *
 * `DressUpModel:SetCreature(id)` asks the server about a creature the client has not cached,
 * and the answer lands in creaturecache.wdb with the appearance ids /contributions/game-data
 * reads -- the same call the addon's portraits rely on (SpokenPlayer/UI/Portrait.lua). The last
 * command walks the list one NPC at a time, retrying each until its model loads or five
 * seconds pass, and prints `id modelFileId` so progress is visible.
 *
 * A chat line takes 255 characters, so the ids are split across as many lines as it takes,
 * each appending to one global list.
 *
 * Free of imports on purpose: the game-data page is a client component and reads it.
