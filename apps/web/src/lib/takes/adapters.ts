/**
 * Where each section archives its takes: the one thing the take layer cannot write once.
 *
 * Everything else about a take is the same in all three -- one table, one commit, one
 * history panel -- but the paths are frozen by AGENTS.md and differ on purpose. A quests
 * file carries its extension and is shared by several NPCs ('gossip/31ab….mp3'); a zones or
 * books file is extension-less and belongs to one line ('1411/razor-hill'). Renaming either
 * means re-shipping a sound pack every user has already downloaded.
 *
 * Every take of a file lives in one directory named after the file, one level deeper than
 * the addon's own path: gossip/31ab….mp3 is archived under audio-history/gossip/31ab…/.
 * What a take's archived file is called is its row's business (`archiveFile`); this only
 * says which directory it is in. There is no live copy anywhere else: the live take is a
 * flag on its row, and a pack build copies it to the addon's path (scripts/audio/sounds.mjs).
 *
 * A total Record rather than a switch, for the reason lib/generation/worker.ts gives:
 * adding a section and forgetting one of these is then a type error rather than a route
 * that resolves to the wrong directory.
 *
 * ANOTHER LANGUAGE'S TAKES LIVE ONE LEVEL DOWN, under a directory named for the language:
 * audio-history/ptBR/gossip/31ab…/. Version numbers count per language, so without it the
 * English v1 and the Portuguese v1 of a file would share a directory and be told apart only
 * by a content hash. English stays exactly where it is -- the archive is irreplaceable and a
 * path it is already at is not moved -- and no English path can begin with a language code:
 * quests paths begin quests/ or gossip/, zones paths a map id, books paths a page id.
