/**
 * A value per language, kept on globalThis and rebuilt when its version moves.
 *
 * On globalThis because `next dev` re-evaluates modules and each evaluation would otherwise
 * start empty; per language because a site switching between two would rebuild on every
 * other request if there were one slot. `version` is compared with ===: a stamp string, or
 * the identity of the array a derived index was built from.
 *
 * A build that returns a promise is cached as the promise, so concurrent callers share one
 * build -- and dropped again if it rejects. Otherwise one timeout would be the answer for
 * that language until the tables next moved.
