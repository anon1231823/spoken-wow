// Filtering, as a pure function of the catalogue.
//
// Everything database-backed arrives in a SearchContext rather than being fetched here,
// which is the split lib/search.ts makes on the quests side and the reason this is
// testable with no database and no filesystem. 1353 rows filter in a linear chain per
// request; there is no index and at this size there does not need to be one.
//
// THE STATE DEFINITIONS ARE THE CLI's. `missing`, `stale` and `current` mean exactly what
// pipelines/zones/tools/voice/generate.mjs's --missing and --stale select, because they
// are computed the same way: stale is take.textHash !== entry.hash, where entry.hash is
// sha1 of the SPOKEN text. If these two ever disagree, the explorer is lying about what
// needs regenerating.
