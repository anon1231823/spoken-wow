/**
 * Against a real Postgres, because what is being tested is a claim about SQL.
 *
 * The catalogue is memoised per process and this app runs two pm2 workers. The zones site
 * dropped its memo by hand after a save, which was correct only while its pm2 config
 * pinned one worker -- an edit saved by worker A left worker B serving the text from
 * before it. The replacement is a stamp every worker reads from the table, so the thing to
 * test is that the stamp moves for every way the table changes. A mocked database would
 * assert that a query was made, which is not the question.
 *
 * Needs DATABASE_URL and migrations applied:
 *   deploy/quests/bin/migrate.sh "$PWD/apps/web"
