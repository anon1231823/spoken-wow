/**
 * What a voice clone is called in the ElevenLabs account, per language.
 *
 * The slot is shared -- dwarf-male-grim is the same NPC voice set in every language -- but
 * the clone is not: each locale's client was voiced by its own actors, so a German slot is
 * cloned from German clips. English's clones keep the names they have always had, so
 * nothing already in the account moves; another language's carries its code after an @,
 * `dwarf-male-grim@deDE`, which no slot name can contain.
 *
 * Client-safe: the voices page shows these.
