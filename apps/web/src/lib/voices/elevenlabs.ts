/**
 * Talking to ElevenLabs about voices.
 *
 * listVoices is the TypeScript twin of fetch_voice_map in tts_cli/voices.py, and the two
 * must agree: the Python pipeline resolves a voice by name at synthesis time, so a voice
 * this app creates is only usable if that function finds it. The name filter is the whole
 * contract, which is why it lives in one place on each side and is tested against the same
 * expectations.
 *
 * `fetch` and the base URL are both injectable, for the reason synthesize.py injects
 * http_post: no test should need an ElevenLabs account, and none should ever spend money.
