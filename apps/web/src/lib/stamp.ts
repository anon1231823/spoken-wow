/**
 * What a versioned table's rows are, as one comparable value, for memos that are validated
 * rather than invalidated (see lib/books/catalogue.ts for why: two pm2 workers).
 *
 * Three terms because there are three ways such a table moves: an edit inserts a version, so
 * the highest id moves; an import can delete, so the count moves; a restore moves the live
 * flag between rows that already exist, which only the sum of live ids notices.
 *
 * A SQL fragment rather than a query, so a stamp over several tables -- another language is
 * read over English's rows and entity_name as well as its own -- is one round trip.
