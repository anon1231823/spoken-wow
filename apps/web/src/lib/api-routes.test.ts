/**
 * Every /api/… path the client asks for has a route behind it.
 *
 * Written after a real failure: the merge moved the zones routes under /api/zones/, and
 * the explorer's Player kept requesting /api/audio/<file>.mp3. Nothing caught it. The
 * types could not -- a URL is a string -- and neither could a build, a typecheck or a lint.
 * The page rendered, every line reported its take, and clicking play did nothing at all,
 * because `audio.play()` on a 404 rejects and the handler that swallows the rejection is
 * there for the ordinary case of a play interrupted by the next one.
 *
 * So the check is here instead: read the literal paths out of the source, read the route
 * directories off disk, and insist that each of the first is served by one of the second.
 * A route that moves without its callers now fails a test rather than a click.
 *
 * It reads paths that are LITERAL up to their first interpolation, which is what makes it
 * both sound and cheap: `/api/zones/audio/${file}.mp3` is checked as far as
 * /api/zones/audio, and that prefix is the part a route move breaks.
