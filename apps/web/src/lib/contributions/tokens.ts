/**
 * The spoken form of a contributed line's template tokens -- REPLACE_DICT in
 * pipelines/quests/tts_cli/tts_utils.py, which is what the extract does to every line it reads.
 *
 * A contribution arrives with the reader's name, class and race already put back as `$N`, `$C`
 * and `$R` (addons/SpokenQuests/Contribute.lua, Detemplate), so it is the same kind of text the
 * extract starts from: the template is the line's `originalText`, and this is its `text`. Left
 * as tokens, `text` would be refused as `invalid-chars` (text-gate.ts) and never voiced.
 *
 * Kept as the Python's table, entry for entry and in its order, so the two can be diffed by
 * eye: a contributed line that said "Traveler" where an extracted one says "Adventurer" would
 * be the same corpus speaking two ways.
