/**
 * The envelopes inside the saved variables file the addon gathers into.
 *
 * The addon's background gathering (addons/SpokenPlayer/Gather.lua) keeps every envelope it
 * would have offered a Contribute link for, and the game writes them into
 * WTF/Account/<account>/SavedVariables/SpokenContributions.lua as Lua string literals. The player
 * uploads that file as it is, so this reads it as it is: every string literal in it, decoded,
 * and kept when it is an envelope. Nothing depends on where in the table the strings sit, so a
 * later change to the store's shape cannot make an older file unreadable.
 *
 * Browser-safe on purpose: the page runs this to preview the upload before anything is sent,
 * and only the envelopes -- never the rest of the file -- leave the player's machine.
