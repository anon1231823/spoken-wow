/**
 * What an envelope becomes once it is accepted for storage.
 *
 * `key` is a triage key and never a frozen line id. `q:33:accept`, `b:{pageTextID}` and
 * `z:{mapID}` name lines that exist; a contribution is about one that does not, which is why a
 * page is keyed on the checksum its client computed. An id is assigned only if triage accepts
 * the row and the pipeline mints one.
 *
 * Server-side only: the hash below reaches for node:crypto, and the browser half of this lives
 * in contributions.ts.
