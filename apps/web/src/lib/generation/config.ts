/**
 * How a line is voiced: the shape of the settings, and the committed defaults.
 *
 * The TypeScript twin of tts_cli/voice_config.py. The field names inside `voiceSettings`
 * stay snake_case because they are sent to ElevenLabs verbatim - the same object
 * build_payload puts on the wire - and renaming them here would mean translating them back
 * at the one place it matters.
 *
 * Nothing in this file touches the database or the filesystem - reading the files lives in
 * files.ts. That split is load-bearing rather than tidy: the settings form is a client
 * component and imports these types and constants, and a `node:fs` anywhere in its import
 * graph fails the production build with an UnhandledSchemeError that neither `pnpm test` nor
 * `pnpm typecheck` will show you.
