/**
 * Every source the app can write must be a source the schema accepts.
 *
 * Against a real Postgres, because the thing being tested lives only there. Adding a
 * section means widening a check constraint on every table that carries one, and the cost
 * of missing one is invisible until the one code path that writes that table runs: books
 * shipped with `regeneration_batch` and `report` still refusing it, so single-page
 * regeneration worked and the first "Regenerate these" click returned a 500.
 *
 * This asks the database which tables constrain a source column and checks them all, rather
 * than listing the ones somebody remembered. A fifth table added later is covered the day it
 * exists.
 *
 * Needs DATABASE_URL and migrations applied:
 *   DATABASE_URL=... bash deploy/web/bin/migrate.sh apps/web
