-- The books corpus: every page of every book, letter and note, with a history.
--
-- WHY A TABLE, WHEN 0022 SAYS EXTRACTED TEXT IS A FILE. 0022 draws the line at who wrote
-- the words: quest text is Blizzard's and lives in a committed corpus, zone lore is written
-- here and lives in a table. Book text is Blizzard's, so the rule points at a file. It is a
-- table anyway, deliberately: the review path for these lines is the zones one -- read a
-- page, correct what the narrator should say, generate, listen -- and that path needs a
-- live version and a history from the first day rather than after the first regret.
--
-- VERSIONED LIKE lore_line. A re-extract inserts a new version and promotes it only when
-- the current version is itself 'extracted'. Without that, `make books-import` is a command
-- that silently discards corrections, and therefore one nobody dares run against a corpus
-- somebody has been editing.
--
-- THE STRUCTURAL FIELDS RIDE ALONG because the Lua export has no other input. They are not
-- editable through the app: which pages exist, and in what order, is the extract's business.
-- An API that let a text edit change "pageId" would be one bad request away from a line the
-- addon can never look up.
--
-- EVERY QUERY NAMES ITS LANGUAGE, for the reason lore_line gives: with more than one
-- language "the current version of this line" has two answers, and an unscoped write clears
-- the other language's live flag. Only enUS exists today; vmangos carries eight more
-- translations in locales_page_text, on these same ids.
--
-- Additive and forward-only per deploy/web/bin/migrate.sh: the table is new.
