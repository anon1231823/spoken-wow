-- The language axis, laid under the tables that did not have one.
--
-- The site is about to serve more than English, switched as a whole by a language in the
-- URL. Most of what a language owns already carries `lang` -- take, report, lore_line,
-- book_line, quest_line, quest_line_speaker, line_flag -- and every read pins it to enUS. What
-- does not carry it is the machinery around a take: the queue that produces one, the ack
-- that clears one, the lexicon log that dirties one, and the issue scan that reads the
-- text. Each of those would let a Portuguese take and an English take of the same file
-- block, clear or dirty each other.
--
-- Default 'enUS' everywhere, so every existing row is correct without a backfill: nothing
-- but English has ever been queued, acked, logged or scanned.
--
-- WIDENED IN TWO RELEASES, NOT ONE. deploy/web/bin/migrate.sh requires a release to run
-- against the schema of the release after it, and the previous release names its conflict
-- targets -- `on conflict ("source", "file")` in queue.ts and dirty.ts. Dropping the old
-- unique index here would make that release's enqueue fail with "no unique or exclusion
-- constraint matching", so the wider index is added beside it and this release's code moves
-- onto it. The old ones are dropped in a later migration, once no running release names
-- them -- and before the first non-English write, which the old index would refuse.

-- Which languages the site serves. The closed set of codes lives in code
-- (pipelines/lib/locales.mjs, mirrored by apps/web/src/lib/lang.ts) because the proxy has to
-- validate a URL prefix without a database round trip; what lives here is whether a language
-- is switched on, which an admin decides at runtime rather than by deploying.
