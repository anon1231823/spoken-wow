-- How far along one section's data is, as one comparable string.
--
-- Run locally and on production by scripts/db/check-synced.sh, with two psql variables:
--   corpus   the section's text table (quest_line, lore_line, book_line)
--   source   the section's name in the take table
-- Fed on stdin rather than written into a command, because the quoting for a query this
-- shape -- single quotes inside a shell command inside an ssh argument -- is unreadable
-- and was got wrong on the first attempt.
--
-- Two stamps, the corpus and the section's takes, each the three terms the apps' own memos
-- use: an edit or a new take inserts a row so the highest id moves, a delete moves the
-- count, and a restore moves the live flag between rows that already exist -- which only
-- the sum of live ids notices.
