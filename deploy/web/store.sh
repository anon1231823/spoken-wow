# Move the audio stores onto the /mnt/voice volume. Run ON THE DROPLET, as root.
#
#   sudo bash deploy/web/store.sh
#
# Idempotent: run it again after adding a directory, or to check the layout is still what
# it should be.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE DISK. The droplet's root filesystem is 33 GB and the two old sites already
# hold ~10 GB of audio between them, which the merge copies rather than moves -- the old
# trees are the rollback. Doing that on root leaves ~2 GB of headroom for releases, logs and
# a database, which is not enough to be relaxed about. /mnt/voice is a 30 GB block volume
# that can be grown without touching the droplet.
#
# WHY SYMLINKS RATHER THAN MOVING THE PATHS. /srv/spoken/shared/<store> is the name
# everything already uses: ecosystem.config.js builds every SPOKEN_*_AUDIO variable from it,
# make/quests.mk and make/zones.mk rsync into it, nginx aliases /downloads/ at it, and the
# cutover copies into it. Pointing that name at the volume changes where the bytes live and
# nothing else, so there is one path to reason about instead of two.
#
# WHAT STAYS ON ROOT. app.env and ecosystem.config.js, which are configuration rather than
# data. And manifest.json, which is not on the volume for a specific reason: it is written
# with write-temp-then-rename, and renaming over a symlink REPLACES THE SYMLINK with a real
# file. It is 384 KB and the `take` table can rebuild it, so it stays where the rename is
# harmless.
