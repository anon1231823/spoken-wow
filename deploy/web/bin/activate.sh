# startOrReload covers both the first deploy and the steady state. --update-env forces pm2

#
# BUT --update-env DOES NOT UPDATE THE SCRIPT PATH. pm2 keeps the `script` it first
# started an app with; reload re-reads the environment and nothing else. When the
# monorepo move changed the path from server.js to apps/web/server.js, every
# reload kept launching the old one, the app errored 70 times over, and the site served
# 502 while pm2 reported the config it was not using. Recovering needed a delete and a
# fresh start, which is what this does automatically now -- but only when the path has
# actually moved, because delete+start drops the connections that a reload preserves.
