setfenv(1, SpokenEnv)

-- Contributing in the background: every line a feature addon would have offered a Contribute
-- button for, kept in SpokenContributions.lua until the player uploads the file.
--
-- WHY THE SAVED VARIABLES AND NOT A LINK. A Contribute link carries one envelope, and a
-- player who meets a hundred gaps in an evening will not click a hundred times. The saved
-- variables file is the one thing an addon can write that leaves the game, and the site's
-- /contribute page reads it back: the envelopes in it are the same bytes a link would carry,
-- so the server checks them exactly as it checks a click.
--
-- Here, not in each feature addon, so there is one file to upload whichever addons gathered.
-- The table itself is SpokenContributionsDB, declared by the SpokenContributions folder the
-- player ships beside itself, so the file is SavedVariables/SpokenContributions.lua and holds
-- nothing but this: a file named after the player would carry its settings along too.
-- Loaded from Contribute.xml alone: the private-server clients, where contributing is off,
-- never have a Gather table, so nothing is gathered there either.
--
-- Keyed by what the line IS (quest, stage and speaker; page checksum), not by the envelope's
-- own checksum: an envelope captured again a second later can differ only in the NPC model a
-- slow cache has since answered, and that should replace the first rather than sit beside it.

-- Read through _G on every call rather than cached: the client assigns the table when the

-- without that folder still gathers, into a table the client simply never writes out.
