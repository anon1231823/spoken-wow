-- ZoneLore -- a popup holding one selectable URL.
--
-- The client has no way to open a browser, so every link this addon offers ends
-- up here: an edit box with the address already highlighted, so the player
-- presses Ctrl+C and Escape and nothing else. Making them select the text first
-- is the difference between a link people use and a link people read.
--
-- StaticPopup rather than a frame of our own, because it brings the dialog
-- backdrop, the Escape handling and the edit box with it, and because a modal is
-- the honest shape for something you have to finish before carrying on.
